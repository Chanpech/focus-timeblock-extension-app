# Focus Timeblock ‚Äì A Minimal Pomodoro-Inspired Web Extension

**Focus Timeblock** is a simple browser extension that helps you stay on task by guiding you through cycles of focus and rest. It's built with productivity in mind‚Äîno distractions, no clutter.

The timer cycles through three modes:
- **Focus** ‚Äì Get stuff done.
- **Short Break** ‚Äì Take a breather.
- **Meal Break** ‚Äì A longer break to recharge.

Built with **Vite**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the excellent `vite-plugin-web-extension`, this extension is lightweight, responsive, and easy to use.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
